      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        When it comes to the hot and sticky Indian summers, there are plenty of
        cold treats that we turn to in order to cool off: Falooda, Watermelon
        Juice, Mango Shake, Lassi, and Banana Shakes are among my favorites. But
        what all these tasty treats are missing is the sweet, sweet buzz of
        eye-opening caffeine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Luckily, this simple coffee milkshake recipe is easy to make and
        combines both caffeine and dessert into one portable cup. I start with
        my Cold Coffee recipe made with instant coffee, then add both ice and
        ice cream to amp up the frosty café-style frappé vibes.

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1.5 tablespoons instant coffee</li>
        <li>¼ cup water warm or lightly hot</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons sugar or as required</li>
        <li>2.5 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>1 or 2 scoops Ice Cream for the milkshake</li>
        <li>
          2 to 4 scoops Ice Cream for topping the coffee shake or as required
        </li>
        <li>4 to 5 ice small cubes optional</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          In a small bowl, take the instant coffee. Add warm or slightly hot
          water. Mix very well with a spoon. Now pour this mixture in a blender
          jar.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add sugar. You can add sugar as per your taste. Blend for a minute or
          till the coffee solution becomes frothy and the color lightens a bit.
        </li>
        <li>
          Now add 4 to 5 small ice cubes. Adding ice cubes are optional and you
          can choose to skip them.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add 1 or 2 vanilla ice cream scoops. Pour 2.5 cups chilled milk. Blend
          once more till everything is mixed well and you get a nice froth on
          top.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour coffee milkshake in glasses. Keep some space on top for the ice
          cream scoops.
        </li>
        <li>
          Now place 1 or 2 ice cream scoops in each glass. Serve coffee
          milkshake with ice cream immediately.
        </li>
      </ol>
