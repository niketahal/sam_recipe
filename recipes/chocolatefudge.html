          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>
            This ridiculously easy recipe is not the traditional old-fashioned
            way of making chocolate fudge, which is why I love it so much.
            Unlike the traditional method, you don’t need to spend hours cooking
            and reducing the fudge mixture. All you need is 3 ingredients and 15
            minutes of time to make this delicious homemade candy!
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s such a time saver during the holidays when all you want to do
            is cook less and spend more time with your family and loved ones.
            Since this fudge recipe is so simple, it’s perfect for making a big
            batch to gift to your friends, neighbors, mailman, or anyone else
            you want to show appreciation to!
          </p>
          <h3>Ingredients</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>1 cup chopped milk chocolate</li>
            <li>200 grams sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Butter</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped walnuts</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Steps</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              First line an aluminium foil or parchment paper in a 6 x 6 inch
              square pan. The foil or parchment paper has to cover all the sides
              and keep some extra on the top.
            </li>
            <li>
              Take the chopped chocolate in a bowl or a small frying pan. Add
              the condensed milk and butter. You can use either salted or
              unsalted butter. Set the bowl or frying pan aside.
            </li>
            <li>
              In a sauce pan or pot heat 1 to 1.5 cups water till it becomes hot
              and begins to boil.
            </li>
            <li>
              Lower the heat and place the small frying pan or bowl containing
              the chocolate, sweetened condensed milk and butter on the pan.
            </li>
            <li>
              Stir and allow the chocolate to melt. Continuously stir the fudge
              mixture while melting the chocolate.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once all the chocolate is melted, turn off the heat. Quickly add
              chopped walnuts and vanilla extract or vanilla powder. Mix very
              well.
            </li>
            <li>
              Then pour the entire chocolate fudge mixture in the pan lined with
              the aluminium foil or parchment paper. Let the fudge cool at room
              temperature. Do not cover the pan.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once the fudge has cooled at room temperature, cover the pan and
              refrigerate the fudge for 3 to 4 hours or overnight till it sets
              completely.
            </li>
            <li>
              Later remove the chocolate fudge along with the foil and place it
              on a chopping board. Remove the foil from the bottom and sides.
              Slice the chocolate fudge into squares or rectangles.
            </li>
          </ol>
